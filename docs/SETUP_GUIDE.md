## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

| Requirement | Minimum Version | Download Link |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Node.js** | v18.0.0+ | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) |
| **npm** | v9.0.0+ | Included with Node.js |
| **Web Browser** | Modern | Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge |

> **Note:** SQLite is bundled with the project - no separate database installation required!

---

## Quick Setup

### Step 1: Verify Node.js Installation

Open your terminal/command prompt and verify:

```bash
# Check Node.js version (should be 18+)
node --version

# Check npm version (should be 9+)
npm --version
```

**Expected Output:**
```
v18.x.x or higher
9.x.x or higher
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project folder and run:

```bash
# Install all required packages
npm install
```

This installs ~15 packages in approximately 30 seconds.

### Step 3: Initialize Database

```bash
# Option A (recommended): do nothing here
# The server will auto-create/migrate skillswap.db on first start.

# Option B: create a fresh DB + load demo data (recommended for judging/testing)
npm run init-db
npm run seed-db
```

**Expected Output:**
```
- Database initialized successfully
- Tables, indexes, triggers, and views created
- Runtime migrations applied (if needed)
- Demo data seeded (if you ran seed-db)
```

### Step 4: Start Server

```bash
npm start
```

**Expected Output:**
```
- SkillSwap server running on http://localhost:3000
- Environment: development
- Security features enabled
- Database connected successfully
```

### Step 5: Access Application

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:3000
